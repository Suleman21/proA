<p>"Graduation is just the beginning. The next step -- whether youâ€™re moving on to an
internship, a full-time job, or continuing your education -- is going to feel ambitious. Hold
on to your successes throughout the program. Remind yourself of a challenge that you
overcame. We believe in you and our alumni team is here to support you even after you
graduate. At Generation, our graduates become lifelong learners, so embrace the
discomfort of the unknown and remember your mindset will carry you 
through!"From Generation Hand-book</p>
